So much context to a photo: date, time, location, weather, number of photos.

So much context to time: mornings, afternoon, night.

So much context to a location: venue, city, country.

So much context to temperature: hot, cold, rainy, windy, perfect

So much context to the number of photos: first, one, twenty.

Venue + night + first photo taken; the start of a meal

Venue + night + day + time + first photo taken; the start of a night out.

Elastic networks pairing us with that context, venue + date + time, sharing moments temporally?

Context to frequency, what you might call your hometown/city, context to your first photo beyond that location. Context: currently traveling, elastic networks with others in the same situation?
