      <h1>Location and elastic networks with photos</h1>
      <p>So much context to a photo: date, time, location, weather, number of photos.</p>

<p>So much context to time: mornings, afternoon, night.</p>

<p>So much context to a location: venue, city, country.</p>

<p>So much context to temperature: hot, cold, rainy, windy, perfect</p>

<p>So much context to the number of photos: first, one, twenty.</p>

<p>Venue + night + first photo taken; the start of a meal</p>

<p>Venue + night + day + time + first photo taken; the start of a night out.</p>

<p>Elastic networks pairing us with that context, venue + date + time, sharing moments temporally?</p>

<p>Context to frequency, what you might call your hometown/city, context to your first photo beyond that location. Context: currently traveling, elastic networks with others in the same situation?</p>
